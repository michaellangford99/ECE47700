	I'm a Senior in Computer Engineering and am mainly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, and any low level coding concepts. I have had the opportunity to work for a startup called Lydonia Technologies where I was able to set up the entire companies backend and client interaction platform. Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing and listening to music, playing video games, running and riding on my electric longboard.
