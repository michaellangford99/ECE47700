<h2>Progress Report for Owen Mandel</h2>
            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/2/2022<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
    <p>I spent this week mainly working on the overall code flow and working out how the full code flow will work. I also contributed to the “Theory of Operation”, “Computational Constraints” and “Economic Constraints” sections of the Functional Specification document.<br>
When trying to figure out the overall navigation code flowchart, I made the diagram shown below which shows the general flow of the code from the main sections and how the code interacts with each other.<br>
 
Figure 1: Navigation Code Flow Chart<br>
I also started the D*Lite code implementation of which the pseudocode is shown below in figure 2 [1]. I am specifically using the optimized version of the code as how fast the path planning runs will determine the speed of the overall drone.<br>

Figure 2: D*Lite Optimized version<br>
Lastly, I researched how to change a 3D Point Cloud into a 2D Occupancy Grid. Some of the results and papers I found include the sources 2-5 and I also started to attempt to understand these algorithms and how I would be able to implement them myself.<br>

<h4>Week 3:</h4>
<b>Date:</b> 9/9/2022<br>
<b>Total hours:</b> 13<br>
<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
<p>I spent most of this week mainly working on the Software Overview, revising the project proposal, and working on coding UART communication between a Raspberry Pi and an STM32F446, as well as starting to write the 3D point cloud to 2D occupancy grid algorithm.<br>
I was writing the UART communication as shown in the first source as well as the figure shown below. This is mainly for the navigation computer to be able to send flight instructions to the microcontroller and for the microcontroller to send sensor data to the navigation single board computer.<br>
 
Figure 1: A diagram of the UART protocol (PC is the Raspberry Pi)<br>
I also was programming the 3D point cloud to 2D occupancy grid algorithm using the sources shown below. I have never coded an algorithm like this before, so I have done research into multiple methods of doing so as shown in the sources 2-5. I am working on the different versions of this algorithm as previously mentioned to see which version works the most optimally for obstacle aversion and the speed of running so on the Raspberry Pi.<br>

<h4>Week 4:</h4>
<b>Date:</b> 9/30/2022<br>
<b>Total hours:</b> 13<br>
<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
<p>This week was completely dedicated to configuring the STM32F411RE Nucleo Board to communicate with the LSM6DSO 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer. I was able to configure as well as write and read from registers on the gyroscope. Some example code of the SPI configuration is shown in Figure 1, and a read signal from one of the registers on the gyroscope shown in Figure 2. <br>

Figure 1: The initialization code for SPI1<br>

Figure 2: Reading a register from the LSM6DSO 6-axis gyroscope<br>

Most of the time this week was spent either debugging the SPI to make sure that it could transmit and receive data via SPI as well as reading the LSM6DSO datasheet to understand how to initialize reading the gyro/accelerometer registers [1].<br>
