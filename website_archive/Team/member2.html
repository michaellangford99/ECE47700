	I'm a Senior in Computer Engineering interested in Cloud Computing, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. This summer I spent my time as an intern at Centene Corporation working in their Digital Cloud Engineering team, and during this semester I'm working as a teaching assistant for Python for Data Science. In my free time I like to listen to music, read, and play video games, but these days I'm trying to transition from video games to leetcode!
