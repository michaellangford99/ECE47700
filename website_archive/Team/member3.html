	I am currently a Senior in Computer Engineering. My interest revolve around game design, 3-D modeling and animating. I've gotten the opportunity to develop my skills in Banco Popular as a member of their AI division. Outside of engineering, I'm also working towards a minor in Economics and a Certificate in Entrepreneurship.
